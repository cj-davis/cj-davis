My name is Cole Davis, and I'm a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder dual majoring in mathematics and economics with a minor in computer science.
The majority of my classes focus on rich theory. Often times, moving from theory to application requires programming. In my computer
science minor, my classes tend to focus on C++; however, I have used a few script languages such as R, STATA, and MATLAB in my economics coursework. I'm also becoming increasingly familiar with Python.
