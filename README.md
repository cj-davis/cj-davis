My name is Cole Davis, and I'm a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder dual majoring in mathematics and economics with a minor in computer science.
The majority of my classes focus on rich theory, and the application of the majority of the theory I explore requires the writing of a program. In my computer
science minor, my classes tend to focus on C++; however, I have used a few script languages such as R, STATA, and MATLAB in my economics coursework.
